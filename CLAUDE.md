# CLAUDE.md - Architectural Guidelines

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with code in this repository to maintain clean, modular, and scalable architecture.

## Project Context

**Project Type**: Multi-language educational website (TutoriAleks)
**Architecture**: Language-first directory structure with global resource sharing
**Current Languages**: Bulgarian (bg) - English (en) and German (de) planned
**Key Pattern**: Iframe-based component architecture with theme variants

### Quick Directory Reference

```
/
├── shared/              # GLOBAL resources (all languages)
│   ├── css/            # Global CSS (variables, animations)
│   └── js/             # Global JavaScript (forms, utilities)
│
└── {lang}/             # LANGUAGE-SPECIFIC (bg/, en/, de/)
    ├── {audience}/     # Target audience (learners/, professionals/)
    │   └── {theme}/    # Theme (white-theme/, dark-theme/)
    │       └── index.html
    └── shared/
        └── components/ # Language-specific HTML components
```

**Path Patterns**:
- Component files to global resources: `../../../shared/css/`
- Landing pages to components: `../../shared/components/`
- JavaScript uses dynamic path resolution based on page depth

**See**: `.claude/docs/FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` for complete structure and path conventions.

## Documentation Structure

**This file (CLAUDE.md)**: Always loaded - contains core principles and quick reference. Keep it concise and focused.

**Detailed Guides** (Referenced, not loaded - consult these when you need detailed information):
- `.claude/docs/ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed architectural patterns and principles
- `.claude/docs/FILE_ORGANIZATION.md` - Directory structure, paths, and migration history
- `.claude/docs/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Comprehensive testing approaches
- `.claude/docs/DEBUGGING_APPROACH.md` - Systematic debugging methodologies
- `.claude/docs/AGENT_WORKFLOWS.md` - When and how to use agents effectively
- `.claude/docs/CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md` - Managing context window efficiently

## Documentation Maintenance

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: You should proactively maintain documentation. After implementing significant changes:
- When you notice a pattern being used multiple times → Consider updating the architecture guide
- When you encounter and fix repeated bugs → Document the pattern in debugging guide
- When you discover workflow improvements → Update agent workflows
- When new conventions emerge → Update relevant guides

You can run `/docs-update check` to analyze if documentation needs updating. Use the `docs-maintainer` agent when you identify patterns that should be documented. The documentation should evolve with the codebase.

## Available Commands

- `/plan` - Create strategic implementation plans for complex features
- `/delegate` - Delegate tasks to agents, keeping main context clean
- `/debug` - First-principles debugging for complex issues
- `/start_task` - Universal task management and context setup
- `/commit` - Smart git commits with logical grouping
- `/status` - Comprehensive project status overview
- `/test` - Smart test execution with various modes
- `/fix` - Auto-fix code issues (linting, formatting)
- `/deps` - Dependency management and security checks
- `/docs-update` - Analyze and update documentation

## Core Architectural Principles

### Code Organization Philosophy

**Modular Design**
- Keep files focused on a single, well-defined purpose
- If scrolling multiple times is needed to understand a module, consider splitting it
- Functions should generally fit within a single screen view when reasonable
- Classes should have clear, cohesive responsibilities

**Complexity Guidelines**
- Monitor cyclomatic and cognitive complexity, not just line counts
- Prioritize readability and maintainability over arbitrary size limits
- Split code when it naturally separates into distinct concerns
- Consider the "rule of three": extract common patterns after three occurrences

### Separation of Concerns

**Layered Architecture**
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface and user interaction handling
- **Business Logic Layer**: Core domain logic and business rules

**Project-Specific Separation**
- **Global Resources** (`/shared/`): Technology-agnostic CSS and JavaScript
- **Language Resources** (`/{lang}/`): Localized content and components
- **Component Isolation**: Iframe-based components with theme variants
- **Centralized Configuration**: Forms managed in `shared/js/forms.js`

### Single Responsibility Principle

**Functions and Methods**
- Each function should do ONE thing and do it well
- Function names should clearly express their single purpose
- If a function name contains "and" or multiple verbs, consider splitting
- Pure functions (no side effects) are preferred where possible

**Classes and Modules**
- Each class should have ONE reason to change
- Modules should export related functionality
- Avoid "god classes" that know too much or do too much
- Prefer composition over inheritance

**Project-Specific SRP**
- **Components**: Each component file handles one UI element (footer, pricing, forms)
- **Themes**: Separate files for light and dark variants (avoid theme conditionals in single file)
- **Languages**: Each language directory is self-contained
- **Path Resolution**: Centralized in JavaScript, not scattered across HTML

## Development Principles

### Clarity and Communication

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Ask Before Assuming**
- **When instructions are ambiguous or unclear**: Always ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- **When multiple interpretations are possible**: Request specific details about the intended approach
- **When requirements seem incomplete**: Ask about missing details that could lead to incorrect implementation
- **When context is unclear**: Confirm your understanding before proceeding
- **Better to ask than sorry**: It's always preferable to ask a clarifying question than to implement something incorrectly and need to redo it

**Examples of When to Ask for Clarification**:
- User says "update the component" without specifying which component or what changes
- User requests "fix the styling" without indicating what specific styling issues to address
- User asks to "add functionality" without defining what functionality is needed
- User mentions "optimize performance" without specifying which performance aspects or metrics
- User says "make it better" without concrete criteria for improvement

### Planning Complex Features
When facing complex implementations:
1. Run `/plan feature-name "description"` to create a comprehensive plan
2. Or use the `strategic-planner` agent directly for planning
3. Plans are saved in `.claude/plans/` as living documents
4. Update plans as you progress through implementation

### Code Quality Standards

**Maintainability**
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Extract complex conditionals into well-named functions
- Use consistent patterns throughout the codebase

**Dependency Management**
- Depend on abstractions, not concretions
- Higher-level modules shouldn't depend on lower-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions
- No circular dependencies allowed
- Minimize coupling between modules

**Error Handling**
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Handle errors at the appropriate level
- Use structured error types/classes
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Never silently swallow exceptions

**Project-Specific Quality Standards**
- **Path Consistency**: Always use the documented path patterns (see FILE_ORGANIZATION.md)
- **Theme Completeness**: Every component must have both light and dark versions
- **Language Independence**: Global resources must never reference specific languages
- **Configuration Over Hard-coding**: Use `FORMS_CONFIG` instead of hard-coded form URLs

### Design Patterns

**Service Pattern**
- Encapsulate business logic in service classes
- Services should be stateless when possible
- Use dependency injection for service dependencies
- Services handle one domain concept

**Observer Pattern**
- Implement event-driven architectures
- Decouple components through events
- Use for cross-cutting concerns
- Enable extensibility without modification

**Project-Specific Patterns**
- **Component Pattern**: Iframe-based isolation with theme variants
- **Path Resolver Pattern**: Dynamic calculation based on page depth
- **Configuration Registry**: Centralized form configuration
- **Language Directory Pattern**: Self-contained language structures

## Architecture Guidelines

### Modularity Requirements

**Module Characteristics**
- High cohesion within modules
- Low coupling between modules
- Clear, well-defined interfaces
- Independent testability
- Single, focused purpose

**Interface Design**
- Design interfaces from the consumer's perspective
- Keep interfaces small and focused
- Use interface segregation principle
- Document interface contracts clearly
- Version interfaces when breaking changes occur

**Project-Specific Modularity**
- **Language Modules**: Each language directory is independently deployable
- **Component Modules**: Each component loads independently via iframe
- **Theme Modules**: Light/dark themes swap without code changes
- **Global Modules**: CSS/JS shared across all language modules

### Performance Considerations

**Optimization Guidelines**
- Profile before optimizing
- Optimize algorithms before micro-optimizations
- Consider time and space complexity
- Cache expensive computations appropriately
- Use lazy loading and pagination for large datasets

**Project-Specific Performance**
- **Parallel Component Loading**: Iframes load independently
- **Shared Resource Caching**: Global CSS/JS cached once for all pages
- **Path Memoization**: Cache path calculations within page lifetime
- **Theme Detection**: Detect once per page load, not per component

## Development Workflow

### Planning Complex Features
When facing complex implementations:
1. Run `/plan feature-name "description"` to create a comprehensive plan
2. Or use the `strategic-planner` agent directly for planning
3. Plans are saved in `.claude/plans/` as living documents
4. Update plans as you progress through implementation

### Adding New Languages (Project-Specific)

1. **Create directory structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p {lang}/learners/white-theme
   mkdir -p {lang}/learners/dark-theme
   mkdir -p {lang}/shared/components
   ```

2. **Copy and translate content** (paths stay the same!):
   ```bash
   cp -r bg/learners {lang}/
   cp -r bg/shared/components {lang}/shared/
   # Translate text content
   ```

3. **Add to forms configuration**:
   ```javascript
   // In shared/js/forms.js
   '{lang}-learners-consultation': {
       url: 'FORM_URL',
       title: 'Translated Title',
       description: 'Translated Description'
   }
   ```

4. **Test**: Verify path resolution works automatically

### Adding New Components (Project-Specific)

1. **Determine scope**:
   - Contains translated text? → `{lang}/shared/components/`
   - Pure CSS/JS? → `/shared/css/` or `/shared/js/`

2. **Create both theme variants**:
   ```bash
   {lang}/shared/components/component.html
   {lang}/shared/components/component-dark.html
   ```

3. **Use correct paths**:
   ```html
   <!-- In component files -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../shared/css/variables.css">
   <script src="../../../shared/js/forms.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Reference from pages**:
   ```html
   <!-- In landing pages -->
   <iframe src="../../shared/components/component.html"></iframe>
   ```

### Agent Collaboration Patterns

**Context-Preserving Workflow**
1. Use `codebase-analyzer` to understand project structure without loading files
2. Use `docs-explorer` to research documentation without cluttering context
3. Implement feature with main Claude using insights from agents
4. Use `test-generator` to create tests in isolation
5. Use `playwright-qa-tester` for browser validation (web projects)
6. Use `task-completion-validator` for final verification

**Sequential Validation**
1. Implement feature with main Claude
2. Use `playwright-qa-tester` for functional validation
3. Use `task-completion-validator` for completeness check
4. Mark task as done only after validation passes

**Parallel Exploration**
- Run `codebase-analyzer` and `docs-explorer` simultaneously for project understanding
- Use `senior-dev-consultant` for architecture review while implementing
- Generate tests with `test-generator` while main Claude continues development
- Can run multiple agents for different aspects simultaneously

**Context Management Best Practices**
- Use `codebase-analyzer` instead of opening many files to understand structure
- Use `docs-explorer` instead of loading extensive documentation
- Use `test-generator` to avoid cluttering main context with test code
- Delegate specialized tasks to agents to keep main Claude focused

**Cost Optimization Notes**:
- The `strategic-planner` uses Opus (highest capability, highest cost) - use for major planning sessions
- The `senior-dev-consultant` uses a more capable model (higher cost) - use for complex problems
- The `investigator`, `test-generator`, and `docs-maintainer` use balanced models - good capability/cost ratio
- The `codebase-analyzer` and `docs-explorer` use efficient models (lower cost) - use liberally

## Continuous Improvement

This document should evolve with the project. When you discover new patterns, anti-patterns, or better approaches, update these guidelines. The goal is to maintain a sustainable, high-quality codebase that remains maintainable as it grows.

Remember: Good architecture enables change. These guidelines ensure the codebase can adapt to new requirements while maintaining quality and developer productivity.
