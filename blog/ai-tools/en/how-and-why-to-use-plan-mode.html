        <h2>What is Cursor?</h2>
        <p>Cursor is an AI-first integrated development environment (IDE) that leverages advanced AI agents to assist programmers in writing code faster and smarter. Beyond simply generating code, Cursor introduces modes that optimize when and how coding happens to create cleaner, more maintainable projects.</p>

        <h2>The Two AI Modes: Plan and Act</h2>
        <p>Cursor uses two complementary modes for AI agents: <strong>Plan mode</strong> and <strong>Act mode</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Plan mode:</strong> In this mode, the AI agent discusses, analyzes, and devises a detailed plan before generating code. It thinks through edge cases, dependencies, and task structure to minimize revisions later.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Act mode:</strong> After planning, the AI switches to Act mode to implement the plan by writing or editing code directly based on the agreed approach.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Why Plan Before You Act?</h2>
        <p>Previously, AI coding assistants often jumped straight into generating code, which led to frequent refactoring when overlooked requirements or architectural decisions became apparent late.</p>
        <p>By discussing the problem first in Plan mode, developers can outline critical details early, allowing the AI to generate higher quality code with fewer errors or omissions.</p>
        <p>This approach saves time and reduces bugs caused by rushed coding and rework.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Example: Handling Multilingual URLs with Cursor</h2>
        <p>For example, in one of my projects, the AI initially did not plan distinct URLs for Bulgarian and English forms, resulting in overlapping routes and confusion.</p>
        <p>Using Plan mode, I asked the AI agent to revisit the routing strategy and explicitly plan different URLs for each language, explaining the reason and impact.</p>
        <p>Once the plan was agreed upon, switching to Act mode let the AI efficiently implement the correct routing logic with minimal refactoring afterward.</p>

        <h2>How to Use Plan Mode and Act Mode in Cursor</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Activate Plan mode:</strong> Start your coding session by enabling Plan mode in Cursor. Input your problem statement or feature request clearly with any context or constraints.</li>
            <li><strong>Engage in AI discussion:</strong> Review the AI’s proposed plan, ask questions, request clarifications, and suggest adjustments until the plan meets your expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Switch to Act mode:</strong> Once the plan is finalized, switch Cursor to Act mode where the AI writes the code according to the plan.</li>
            <li><strong>Review and iterate if needed:</strong> Validate the generated code and only request changes if the implementation strays from the agreed plan, which should now be rare.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>By leveraging Cursor’s Plan and Act modes, developers can collaborate with AI agents effectively, allowing more thoughtful, structured coding sessions that minimize time-consuming refactoring and improve overall code quality.</p>
