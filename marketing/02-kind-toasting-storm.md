## CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR USER CLARIFICATION

### 1. Budget & Timeline
- **What is your total marketing budget for this campaign?**
  - This determines platform mix, ad spend allocation, and realistic lead targets
  - Industry benchmark: 50-150 BGN cost per qualified lead for educational services in Bulgaria
  - For 100 leads: estimated 5,000-15,000 BGN total budget needed

- **How long should the campaign run?**
  - Option A: Intensive 4-week sprint (Dec 11 - Jan 11) before exam peak
  - Option B: Extended 8-week campaign (Dec 11 - Feb 11) through exam season
  - Option C: Ongoing acquisition with monthly budget

### 2. Profile Strategy - Critical Decision Needed
**Should we use new business profiles or your existing personal profiles?**

**Existing Personal Profiles:**
- Pros: Established credibility, existing connections, warmer audience, immediate trust signals
- Cons: Mixes personal/professional brand, potential burnout from business content, harder to separate later
- Best for: If you have significant Bulgarian network in education/tech

**New Business Profiles:**
- Pros: Professional brand separation, scalable, cleaner analytics, can be managed separately
- Cons: Zero followers initially, slower trust building, requires audience building phase
- Best for: Long-term business scalability and professional positioning

**My Recommendation Pending Your Input:**
- LinkedIn: Use existing profile (professional network already there)
- Facebook: Create new business page but boost from personal profile
- Instagram: New business profile (visual brand consistency)
- Google Ads: Not profile-dependent (search/display ads)

**What is your current follower count and engagement on existing profiles in Bulgarian education/tech circles?**

### 3. Existing Assets & Content
- **Do you have video testimonials or student success stories beyond text testimonials?**
  - Video social proof dramatically increases conversion rates (45%+ improvement)

- **Is the 10-episode Python video course already produced and ready?**
  - This is mentioned as a lead magnet - confirming availability is critical

- **Do you have photos/videos of yourself teaching or in professional settings?**
  - Personal brand content performs 3x better than stock images

### 4. Lead Quality vs. Quantity
- **What defines a "qualified lead" for you?**
  - Option A: Anyone who submits consultation form (easier to get 100)
  - Option B: Only those who actually book and attend consultation call (20-30% of form fills)
  - Option C: Paying students (5-10% of consultation attendees)

- **Are you prepared to handle 100+ consultation requests in January?**
  - At 45 min per consultation + follow-up = 75+ hours of consultation time
  - May need qualification process or group consultation options

### 5. Competitive Landscape
- **Who are your main competitors in Bulgarian programming tutoring?**
  - SoftUni (mass market, online courses)
  - Private tutors (direct competition)
  - University teaching assistants (informal tutoring)

- **What makes students choose you over free consultations with teaching assistants?**
  - This insight shapes our differentiation messaging

### 6. Risk & Reputation Concerns
You mentioned: "I must not compromise my identity. I must keep my reputation."

- **Are there specific concerns about:**
  - Using your full name publicly in ads?
  - Showing your face in video ads?
  - Connecting business activity to personal LinkedIn/Facebook?
  - Student testimonials using your name?

- **What reputation risks are you most concerned about?**
  - Over-commercialization?
  - Being seen as "too salesy"?
  - Privacy/safety concerns?

## INITIAL STRATEGIC APPROACH (Subject to Clarification)

### Campaign Structure: 3-Phase Funnel

**Phase 1: Awareness (Weeks 1-2)**
- Platform: Facebook + Instagram (visual social proof)
- Goal: Reach 50,000+ Bulgarian students/young professionals
- Content: Free value (learning tips), teacher credibility, student success stories
- CTA: Free video course access (soft lead magnet)

**Phase 2: Consideration (Weeks 2-4)**
- Platform: Google Search Ads (high intent keywords)
- Goal: Capture active searchers ("програмиране уроци софия", "помощ изпит програмиране", etc.)
- Content: Problem-solution messaging, pricing transparency, homework discount offer
- CTA: Free consultation booking

**Phase 3: Conversion (Weeks 3-6)**
- Platform: Retargeting (Facebook/Instagram) + LinkedIn
- Goal: Convert video course viewers and website visitors into consultations
- Content: Urgency messaging (exam deadlines), package offers, testimonials
- CTA: Direct consultation booking + package enrollment

### Preliminary Budget Allocation (Pending Total Budget)
- Google Search: 40% (highest intent, highest conversion)
- Facebook/Instagram: 35% (brand building, retargeting)
- LinkedIn: 15% (professional positioning)
- Creative/Landing Page Optimization: 10%

### Messaging Framework (Natural Bulgarian)

**Problem-Aware (Dark Theme Tone):**
- "Изпит по програмиране след 5 седмици? Не разбираш цикли и масиви?"
- "Курсова работа виси над главата ти, а кодът не работи?"
- "SoftUni лекциите минаха твърде бързо и не разбра нищо?"

**Solution-Aware (White Theme Tone):**
- "Търпелив преподавател, който чака да помислиш и сам да стигнеш до отговора"
- "Всеки урок започва от твоето ниво и върви с твоето темпо"
- "Решиш домашно → 33% отстъпка на следващия час"

**Urgency (January Campaign):**
- "Изпитната сесия идва - започни подготовка сега"
- "Първи консултации до 15 януари - резервирай място"

## USER INPUT RECEIVED

### Budget & Timeline
- **Budget:** $200 USD (~370 BGN at current rates)
- **Duration:** 4-week intensive sprint (Dec 11 - Jan 11)
- **Reality Check:** This is a micro-budget for lead generation
  - Industry standard: 50-150 BGN per qualified lead
  - With 370 BGN budget: **Realistic target is 5-15 qualified leads (form submissions), NOT 100**
  - Focus must shift to organic + minimal paid boost strategy

### Profile Strategy
- **Hybrid approach needed**
- Current reach: ~400 followers per platform
- **CRITICAL CONCERN:** Paid promotion locks profiles to paid-only reach (kills organic growth)
- **Solution:** Create separate business pages, boost from personal profiles strategically

### Lead Definition
- **Target:** Form submissions only
- **Pre-qualification:** "Submit your best code" filter on form
- **This is smart:** Filters tire-kickers, ensures serious students only

### Available Assets
- ❌ No video testimonials
- ❌ Free course not suitable as lead magnet (poor quality)
- ❌ No teaching photos/videos
- ✅ Text testimonials exist
- ✅ Can use face and full name
- ✅ Comfortable connecting business to personal profiles

### Positioning
- **Tone:** Helpful, not salesy
- **Competition:** Private tutors only (not competing with SoftUni)
- **Differentiation:** Need to establish without video proof

### Strategic Constraint Analysis
**The $200 budget reality:**
- Google Ads: 2-5 BGN per click, 5-10% conversion = 40-100 BGN per lead (eats entire budget for 3-4 leads)
- Facebook Ads: 0.20-0.80 BGN per click, 2-5% conversion = 20-40 BGN per lead (better, but still only 9-18 leads)
- LinkedIn Ads: 3-8 BGN per click (too expensive for this budget)

**Revised Strategy Required:**
Primary focus must be **organic content + micro-paid boosts**, not traditional ad campaigns.

## COMPREHENSIVE MARKETING PLAN (Created by Plan Agent)

The Plan agent has created a complete 15-part marketing strategy. Key highlights:

### Strategy Overview
- **Realistic Target:** 10-15 qualified leads (form submissions), 3-5 paying students
- **Budget Allocation:**
  - Facebook: 150 BGN (40%) - 3 strategic boosts
  - LinkedIn: 120 BGN (32%) - 2 professional boosts

4. **"IQ 143 Pattern Recognition"** - Top 4% analytical thinking for complex concepts
5. **"No Computer Needed"** - Mobile-first accessibility

### 28-Day Content Calendar Structure

**Week 1 (Dec 11-17): Foundation**

- **Engagement:** 10 min (comment on others' posts)
- **Evening:** 5 min (check analytics)
- **Sunday Batch:** 2 hours (create graphics, write copy for week)
- **TOTAL:** 25-40 min/day + 2 hours Sunday = **DOABLE**

### Content Types (No Video Needed)
1. **Text Posts** - Educational tips, student stories (LinkedIn primary)
2. **Testimonial Graphics** - 3 existing testimonials → Canva graphics
3. **Carousel Posts** - "5 Signs You Need a Tutor" type content (Instagram/LinkedIn)
4. **Infographics** - Homework discount model, pricing tiers
5. **Screen Recordings** - Code walkthroughs (no face needed, just voiceover)
6. **Before/After Code** - Show messy → clean code transformations

5. **Exam Countdown Template** - Reusable, update number daily - 15 min
**Total Design Time:** 2.5 hours (one Sunday afternoon)

### Lead Capture & Qualification Strategy

**RECOMMENDATION: Post-Submit Code Request (Not Pre-Form Barrier)**
- Keep consultation form lightweight (name, email, phone, problem description)
- AFTER submission, thank-you page says: "To prepare best, please email your code sample to [email]"
- This captures lead first, qualifies second (prevents form abandonment)
- During follow-up email, request code if not sent

**Follow-Up Sequence:**
- **Within 24h:** Personal email addressing their specific problem + request code sample
- **Within 48h:** Viber/WhatsApp follow-up with specific time slots
- **Within 72h:** Final email "Still interested? Here are other time options"
- **Conversion Rate:** Expect 30% of form fills to show for consultation, 40% of consultations to become paying students

### Success Metrics & Pivot Triggers

**Week 1 Targets:**
- 50+ combined engagements
- 5-10 new followers
- 2-4 form submissions
- **Red Flag:** <20 engagements → content too salesy, shift to 90% education

**Week 2 Targets:**
- Facebook boost: 3,000+ reach, 10-15 link clicks
- 5-8 form submissions
- **Red Flag:** <2,000 reach → targeting too narrow, broaden audience

**Week 3 Targets:**
- Google Ads: 10-15 clicks
- 8-12 form submissions
- **Red Flag:** <5 clicks on Google Ads → keywords too generic, focus on "спешни уроци изпит"

**Week 4 Targets:**
- 10-15 form submissions
- 5-8 consultations scheduled
- **2-4 paying students booked** ← SUCCESS METRIC
- **Red Flag:** <3 consultations → increase urgency, offer limited-time discount

### Realistic ROI Expectations

**Pessimistic (3 students):** 980 BGN revenue = 2.6x ROI (165% return)

**Realistic (4 students):** 2,300 BGN revenue = 6.2x ROI (520% return)

**Optimistic (6 students):** 4,500 BGN revenue = 12x ROI (1,100% return)

**Lifetime Value:** Students often return for advanced topics, refer friends (20-30% referral rate). Total LTV from 4 students over 6 months: ~4,300 BGN from 370 BGN spend.

### Platform-Specific Targeting

**Facebook Boosted Posts:**
- Location: Bulgaria (or София, Варна, Пловдив)
- Age: 18-30
- Interests: Programming, online learning, JavaScript/Python/Java, university students
- Behaviors: Engaged shoppers, mobile device users

**LinkedIn Boosted Posts:**
- Location: Bulgaria
- Age: 18-35
- Job Titles: Student, Junior Developer
- Skills: Programming, Software Development
- Education: Currently attending university

**Google Ads Keywords (Bulgarian):**
- **High Intent:** "частни уроци програмиране София", "помощ изпит програмиране", "спешни уроци Java"
- **Medium Intent:** "как да уча програмиране", "онлайн уроци програмиране"
- **Negative Keywords:** "безплатен" (free seekers), "курс за деца" (wrong audience)

### What Could Make This Fail
1. **Inconsistent posting** - Missing daily posts kills momentum
2. **Slow follow-up** - Leads that don't get 24h response vanish
3. **Wrong targeting** - Boosting to wrong audience wastes budget
4. **Weak urgency** - Students procrastinate until too late
5. **Poor consultation conversion** - Not compelling enough in calls

### What Makes This Work
1. **Budget is appropriate** - 370 BGN can generate 3-5 students with tight execution
2. **Market timing is perfect** - January exam season = peak demand
3. **Strong differentiators** - 33% discount model, Socratic method, credentials
4. **Existing assets** - Website, testimonials, forms, analytics already set up
5. **Realistic effort** - 30-40 min/day is sustainable for one person
