## VERIFICATION PROCESS

### Step 1: Initial Answer

Creating Midjourney prompts for 8 distinct background categories from the 100 FB ads.

### Step 2: Verification Questions

1. **Are the prompts optimized for Midjourney v6 syntax (current version)?**
2. **Do the prompts avoid showing faces/identifiable people (GDPR/privacy)?**
3. **Are the prompts specific enough to generate CONSISTENT images across multiple generations?**
4. **Do the images work for text overlay (sufficient contrast, empty space)?**
5. **Are the prompts culturally appropriate for Bulgarian audience?**

### Step 3: Answers to Verification Questions

**Answer 1:** Need to use Midjourney v6 syntax: `--style raw --ar 4:5` for Instagram/Facebook optimal ratio, `` flag, specific lighting/camera terms.

**Answer 2:** CRITICAL - Cannot show identifiable faces due to privacy. Use "anonymous", "from behind", "silhouette", "out of focus" techniques.

**Answer 3:** Add specific details: camera angle, lighting type, color palette, time of day, exact objects visible.

**Answer 4:** YES - must specify "copy space", "negative space", "centered composition" to leave room for text overlay.

**Answer 5:** Bulgarian students use similar workspace aesthetics to Western Europe (modern laptops, coffee culture, minimalist desks) - prompts are appropriate.

### Step 4: Final Corrected Answer

Below are optimized Midjourney v6 prompts with privacy protections, text-overlay space, and consistent generation parameters.

## USAGE GUIDELINES

### Midjourney Generation Best Practices:

**For Consistent Style Across All Images:**
1. Always include `--ar 4:5` (optimal for Instagram/Facebook feeds)
2. Always include `--style raw` (more photorealistic, less artistic interpretation)
3. Always include `` (latest Midjourney version)

**To Avoid Variations:**
- Use seed parameter if you need exact consistency: `--seed 12345`
- Use same camera/lighting terms across related images

**Privacy Protection:**
- All prompts use "anonymous from behind", "hands only", "silhouette", "out of focus"
- Never generate identifiable faces
- Avoid any personal/identifying details

**Text Overlay Space:**
- "copy space at top third" = room for headline
- "negative space centered" = room for centered quote
- "space at top and bottom" = room for both headline and CTA

### Image Post-Processing:

After generating in Midjourney:
1. **Upscale** to 2048px minimum
2. **Adjust contrast** slightly if text will overlay (test readability)
3. **Add subtle vignette** to draw eye to center where text will be
4. **Check on mobile** - 80% of views are mobile

### Cost Estimate:

- Midjourney Standard Plan: $30/month = 15 hours GPU time
- Each image generation: ~1 minute
- 100 images = ~100 minutes of GPU time
- **Budget: 2-3 days of Standard plan** to generate all backgrounds

### Alternative Free Options:

If budget doesn't allow Midjourney:
1. **Unsplash/Pexels** - Search terms from prompts work well
2. **Leonardo.ai** - Similar quality, has free tier
3. **Stable Diffusion** - Free but requires technical setup
4. **Phone Photography** - Recreate setups yourself (most authentic!)
