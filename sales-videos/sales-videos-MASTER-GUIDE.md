## 💡 Key Principles to Remember

### **Vulnerability Over Bragging**
❌ "I scored 92% on Java certification"
✅ "I failed AST and felt inferior watching friends at the beach - that taught me how to actually learn"

### **Specificity Creates Connection**
❌ "I was stressed"
✅ "10-ти януари 2004, очите ми течаха от напрежение, притеснявах се че приятелите ми ще ме отлъчат"

### **Transformation Arc Maintains Authority**
1. **Vulnerability**: "I struggled deeply"
2. **Transformation**: "Here's what changed"
3. **Authority**: "Now I teach students to avoid this pain"

### **FMD > FOMO**
❌ "Book in next 24 hours for 50% off!"
✅ "Path A: Continue struggling alone. Path B: Get structured help. Your choice."

## 📞 Call-to-Action Framework

### **Soft CTA** (Awareness stage):
